# CacheWarp
**A high-performance API caching middleware powered by FastAPI**

## Overview
CacheWarp is an intelligent reverse proxy that sits between clients and API servers, dramatically reducing origin server load while maintaining data freshness. Built with Python and FastAPI, it implements cutting-edge caching strategies inspired by companies like Stripe and Shopify to optimize API performance.

## Problem & Solution
Modern applications face several challenges with API performance:
- 40% of API calls are redundant (according to industry research)
- Cloud infrastructure costs can grow 2.5x without proper caching
- Poor caching strategies result in either stale data or high latency

CacheWarp solves these problems by:
- Reducing origin server load by over 90%
- Decreasing API latency from ~300ms to ~50ms (P99)
- Providing substantial savings in cloud infrastructure costs

## Key Features

### Core Caching Capabilities
- **Two-Tier Caching Architecture**: L1 (memory) + L2 (Redis) for optimal performance
- **Adaptive TTL Engine**: Dynamic cache expiration based on content type and request patterns
- **Request Deduplication**: Prevents cache stampede using Redis locks
- **Stale-While-Revalidate**: Serves cached data immediately while refreshing in background

### Production-Ready Design
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Detects origin failures and triggers fallback mechanisms
- **Comprehensive Observability**: Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards
- **High Scalability**: Docker and Kubernetes deployment support
- **Cache Invalidation API**: Fine-grained control for content freshness

## Performance Goals
- **Throughput**: 8,000+ requests per second
- **Latency**: Sub-90ms P99 latency
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: >90% for optimized efficiency
- **Origin Load Reduction**: 90%+ reduction in backend requests

## Technical Stack
- **FastAPI**: High-performance async web framework
- **Redis**: Distributed caching layer
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Metrics and monitoring
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: Containerization and orchestration

```

## Future Improvements (Inspired by Segcache)

Future enhancements based on ["Segcache: a memory-efficient and scalable in-memory key-value cache for small objects"](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi21/presentation/yang-juncheng):
- Proactive expiration using TTL-indexed segments for bulk removal.
- Reduce per-object metadata to ~5 bytes with shared segment headers.
- Eliminate memory fragmentation with fixed-size segments in L1 cache.
- Merge-based eviction to retain high-frequency objects and reduce miss ratios.
- Improve scalability with thread-local segments and minimal locking.
- Add a 1-byte frequency counter for better eviction decisions.
